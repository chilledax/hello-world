# hello-world

This is my first Github repository. The start of my journey learning to write code properly. I've dabbled in the past and have a reletaivley decent knowledge of HTML and CSS but now I want to improve my knowledge of backend development and will be starting with Elixir and Phoenix.

This is where I'll share my Elixir / Phoneix experiments as I learn.
